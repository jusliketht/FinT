## Cursor Prompt: Fix Client-Side Application Startup Issues

**Goal:** Resolve the `Invalid options object. Dev Server has been initialized using an options object that does not match the API schema. - options.allowedHosts[0] should be a non-empty string.` error and ensure the React client application starts successfully.

**Current State:**
- The backend server is starting successfully.
- The client application fails to start with the `allowedHosts` error.
- There are `npm ERESOLVE` errors related to `react-scripts` and `typescript` peer dependencies.
- Previous attempts to fix involved modifying `package.json` and `.env` files, and reinstalling `node_modules`, but the issue persists.

**Tasks for Cursor:**

1.  **Analyze `package.json` and `node_modules`:**
    *   Inspect `client/package.json` to understand the current `react-scripts` and `typescript` versions.
    *   Review the `npm ERESOLVE` error logs (if available) to pinpoint the exact conflicting versions.
    *   Consider if a specific version of `react-scripts` or `webpack-dev-server` is required for compatibility with the current project setup.

2.  **Address `react-scripts` and `typescript` compatibility:**
    *   Attempt to find a compatible set of `react-scripts` and `typescript` versions that resolve the peer dependency conflicts.
    *   If necessary, explicitly set the `typescript` version in `client/package.json` that is compatible with `react-scripts`.
    *   Run `npm install` after any `package.json` modifications.

3.  **Investigate `allowedHosts` configuration:**
    *   The error `options.allowedHosts[0] should be a non-empty string` suggests an issue with the `webpack-dev-server` configuration used by `react-scripts`.
    *   Explore common solutions for this error in `create-react-app` environments, such as:
        *   Ensuring the `HOST` environment variable is correctly set (e.g., `HOST=0.0.0.0`).
        *   Checking for any explicit `allowedHosts` configurations in `package.json` or `webpack` configuration files (if ejected).
        *   Considering if `DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true` is still needed or if it's causing conflicts.

4.  **Verify client application startup:**
    *   After making changes, attempt to start the client application using `npm start`.
    *   Monitor the console output for any new errors or successful startup messages.

5.  **Confirm financial report component imports:**
    *   Double-check `client/src/routes.jsx` and `client/src/pages/Reports/index.jsx` to ensure all financial report components (`TrialBalance`, `ProfitAndLoss`, `BalanceSheet`, `CashFlow`) are correctly imported from `../../components/reports/`.
    *   Ensure there are no lingering references to `./pages/reports/` for these components in `routes.jsx`.

**Expected Outcome:**
- The React client application starts without any `allowedHosts` or other compilation/runtime errors.
- The application is accessible in the browser, and all routes, especially those related to financial reports, load correctly.

**Action:** Proceed with the above steps to diagnose and fix the client-side startup issues.
