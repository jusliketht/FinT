Cursor Prompt: Comprehensive Feature Refinements and Quality Assurance

Goal: Implement comprehensive validations, exception handling, notifications, error handling, mobile responsiveness, and ensure all features and sub-features are working correctly with proper navigation.

Tasks for Cursor:

1. Form Validations and Input Handling

Client-Side Validations:

•
Transaction Forms: Validate required fields (date, amount, description), amount format, date ranges

•
Business Forms: Validate business name, address, tax ID format

•
Account Forms: Validate account name, account code uniqueness, account type selection

•
User Profile Forms: Validate email format, password strength, required fields

Validation Implementation:

•
Use Chakra UI form validation or React Hook Form with Yup schema validation

•
Display inline error messages with red text and error icons

•
Prevent form submission until all validations pass

•
Show field-level validation on blur and form-level validation on submit

•
Implement real-time validation feedback for better UX

Input Formatting:

•
Currency inputs with proper formatting (commas, decimal places)

•
Date inputs with consistent format and date picker

•
Phone number formatting

•
Tax ID/Business registration number formatting

•
Percentage inputs for tax rates

  message: string;
  errors?: string[];
  statusCode: number;
  timestamp: string;
}
