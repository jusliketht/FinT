This prompt outlines a comprehensive plan to address the critical issues, missing features, and UI/UX enhancements identified in the FinT application. The development will be structured in phases to ensure a systematic approach to resolving the current challenges and building a robust, user-friendly financial management system.

## Overall Goal

To transform the FinT application into a fully functional, stable, and aesthetically pleasing financial management system by resolving critical bugs, implementing missing core functionalities, and refining the user interface and experience.

## Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixing and Infrastructure Stabilization

**Goal:** Resolve all compilation errors, establish stable backend-frontend communication, and fix the user registration process to enable basic application access.

**Key Tasks:**

### 1.1 Resolve Frontend Build and Compilation Errors

**Problem:** The client application fails to compile due to various import errors, undefined components, and syntax issues.

**Actionable Steps:**

*   **Review and Correct `src/pages/Dashboard/index.jsx`:**
    *   Identify and remove duplicate import declarations for `ArrowUpIcon` and `ArrowDownIcon`. Ensure these icons are imported correctly from `react-icons/fi` and not from `@chakra-ui/react` if they are not exported by Chakra UI.
    *   Verify that all Chakra UI components used (e.g., `SimpleGrid`, `VStack`, `HStack`) are correctly imported from `@chakra-ui/react`.
    *   Ensure proper usage of `FiArrowUp` and `FiArrowDown` from `react-icons/fi` where `ArrowUpIcon` and `ArrowDownIcon` were previously used.

*   **Review and Correct `src/components/bills/CreateBillModal.jsx`:**
    *   Ensure `VStack` and `HStack` are correctly imported from `@chakra-ui/react`.
    *   Check for and remove any duplicated import statements.
    *   Verify that all other Chakra UI components are correctly imported.

*   **Clean and Reinstall Node Modules:**
    *   Navigate to the `client` directory: `cd /home/ubuntu/FinT/client`
    *   Remove `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`
    *   Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
    *   Reinstall dependencies: `npm install`
    *   Attempt to build the client again: `npm run build`

### 1.2 Stabilize Backend Server and Database Connection

**Problem:** The backend server is not consistently running, leading to connection refused errors and failed API calls.

**Actionable Steps:**

*   **Ensure Backend Server is Running:**
    *   Navigate to the `server` directory: `cd /home/ubuntu/FinT/server`
    *   Start the backend server in development mode: `npm run start:dev`
    *   Monitor the console output for any errors or warnings related to database connection or server startup.

*   **Verify Prisma Migrations:**
    *   Ensure the database schema is up-to-date by running Prisma migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` (if not already done).
    *   Address any errors during migration, such as database connection issues or schema conflicts.

*   **Check Backend .env Configuration:**
    *   Verify that the `.env` file in `/home/ubuntu/FinT/server` has the correct `DATABASE_URL` and other necessary environment variables configured.

### 1.3 Fix User Registration Functionality

**Problem:** Users cannot register, and the registration process fails silently or with generic error messages.

**Actionable Steps:**

*   **Debug Registration API Endpoint:**
    *   In `server/src/auth/auth.controller.ts` and `server/src/auth/auth.service.ts`, add detailed logging to the registration endpoint to capture request data, validation errors, and database interactions.
    *   Verify that the `AuthService.register` method correctly hashes passwords and saves user data to the database.
    *   Ensure proper error handling is implemented in the backend to return meaningful error messages to the frontend.

*   **Enhance Frontend Registration Error Handling:**
    *   In `client/src/pages/Auth/Register.jsx` (or similar registration component), modify the `onSubmit` handler to properly capture and display error messages received from the backend.
    *   Use Chakra UI `useToast` to show specific error messages to the user (e.g., 



## Phase 2: Comprehensive Feature Functionality Testing and Core Feature Implementation

**Goal:** Systematically test all existing features, identify and fix functional bugs, and implement the core financial functionalities that are currently missing or broken.

**Key Tasks:**

### 2.1 Global Transaction Management

**Problem:** Most listing and filtering features for transactions are missing, and adding an account from the add transaction modal is not working.

**Actionable Steps:**

*   **Implement Transaction Listing with Filters and Search:**
    *   In `client/src/pages/Transactions/index.jsx` (or relevant transaction listing component), implement robust data fetching and display for transactions.
    *   Add filtering capabilities by date range, account, type (income/expense), and category.
    *   Integrate a search bar to allow users to search transactions by description or amount.
    *   Ensure pagination is implemented for large datasets.
    *   On the backend, in `server/src/transactions/transactions.controller.ts` and `server/src/transactions/transactions.service.ts`, implement the necessary API endpoints and logic to support filtered and paginated transaction retrieval.

*   **Fix "Add Account from Add Transaction Modal" Functionality:**
    *   Investigate the `client/src/components/transactions/AddTransactionModal.jsx` (or similar) to identify why adding a new account from within the modal is not working.
    *   Ensure that the modal correctly interacts with the backend API (`/api/accounts`) to create new accounts.
    *   Implement proper state management to update the list of available accounts in the modal after a new account is added.

### 2.2 Bank Reconciliation

**Problem:** Core bank reconciliation features are not implemented.

**Actionable Steps:**

*   **Implement Bank Reconciliation Logic:**
    *   In `server/src/reconciliation/reconciliation.service.ts`, implement the core logic for bank reconciliation. This should involve:
        *   Matching imported bank statement transactions with internal journal entries.
        *   Allowing manual matching and unmatching of transactions.
        *   Calculating reconciliation statistics (e.g., number of matched transactions, outstanding transactions, difference).
    *   In `client/src/pages/bankStatements/BankReconciliation.jsx`, develop the UI for bank reconciliation, including:
        *   Displaying imported bank statement transactions and internal journal entries side-by-side.
        *   Providing controls for matching/unmatching transactions.
        *   Displaying reconciliation status and statistics.

*   **Integrate PDF Statement Parsing:**
    *   Ensure the `server/src/pdf-statement/pdf-statement.controller.ts` and `server/src/pdf-statement/pdf-statement.service.ts` are correctly parsing PDF bank statements and converting them into a usable format for reconciliation.
    *   Address any issues with password-protected PDFs or different bank statement formats.

### 2.3 Invoice and Bill Management

**Problem:** Invoice and Bill management features are disabled due to Prisma client issues.

**Actionable Steps:**

*   **Resolve Prisma Client Generation for Invoice/Bill Models:**
    *   Ensure that the `prisma/schema.prisma` file correctly defines the `Invoice` and `Bill` models.
    *   Run `npx prisma generate` in the `server` directory to regenerate the Prisma client. Address any errors that prevent the client from being generated correctly.
    *   Verify that the generated client includes the `Invoice` and `Bill` models.

*   **Enable and Test Invoice/Bill Functionality:**
    *   In `server/src/invoices/invoices.controller.ts`, `server/src/invoices/invoices.service.ts`, `server/src/bills/bills.controller.ts`, and `server/src/bills/bills.service.ts`, ensure that the API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting invoices and bills are fully functional.
    *   In `client/src/pages/invoices/index.jsx` and `client/src/pages/bills/index.jsx`, enable and test the UI components for managing invoices and bills. This includes:
        *   Creating new invoices/bills.
        *   Viewing a list of invoices/bills.
        *   Marking invoices/bills as paid.
        *   Editing and deleting invoices/bills.

### 2.4 User Profile and Business Management

**Problem:** The business and personal profile switch is improper in terms of UI, and business registration details (PAN/GST) need to be implemented.

**Actionable Steps:**

*   **Refine Business/Personal Profile Switch UI/UX:**
    *   In `client/src/components/layout/Layout.jsx` or a dedicated profile switch component, redesign the business/personal profile switch to be intuitive and visually appealing.
    *   Ensure a clear visual indication of the currently active profile.
    *   Implement smooth transitions when switching between profiles.

*   **Implement Business Registration Details (PAN/GST):**
    *   In `server/src/business/business.controller.ts` and `server/src/business/business.service.ts`, add fields for PAN (Permanent Account Number) and GST (Goods and Services Tax) registration details to the `Business` model.
    *   Implement API endpoints to allow users to add, view, and update these details for each business.
    *   In `client/src/pages/business/BusinessManagement.jsx` (or a dedicated business profile page), create UI elements for users to input and manage their business's PAN and GST details.
    *   Ensure proper validation for PAN and GST numbers.

## Phase 3: UI/UX Refinement and Quality Assurance
