# FinT Application Architecture Design

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the proposed architecture for the FinT (Financial Tracking) application, a modern financial tracking solution for managing journal entries, bookkeeping, statements, and bank/credit card management. The design aims to leverage the existing tech stack while ensuring scalability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices in financial software development.

## 2. Existing Tech Stack Overview

Based on the provided GitHub repository, the FinT application utilizes the following core technologies:

### Frontend
*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Chakra UI & Tailwind CSS**: UI component library and a utility-first CSS framework for styling.
*   **Redux Toolkit**: For efficient state management.
*   **React Router**: For declarative routing.
*   **Axios**: For making HTTP requests.

### Backend
*   **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
*   **Prisma**: A next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript.
*   **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system.

## 3. Core Financial Functionality Requirements

The FinT platform is designed to support comprehensive financial tracking, including:

*   Parsing password-protected PDF credit card and bank statements to generate journal entries.
*   Tagging each journal entry with a person/entity and linking it to appropriate accounts from the chart of accounts.
*   Processing invoice entries and matching them with business accounts.
*   Allowing each user to add and manage multiple businesses.
*   Maintaining separate accounting records for each business, distinct from its owners and users.
*   Real-time generation of ledgers from journal entries.
*   On-demand generation of Trial Balance, Balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss statements for stipulated timeframes (month, quarter, 6 months, yearly, and till date).
*   Inclusion of GST and TDS as integral account heads within the chart of accounts.

## 4. Proposed Architecture

The architecture will follow a clear separation of concerns, with a distinct frontend and backend communicating via RESTful APIs. The database will serve as the persistent storage for all financial data.

### 4.1. Frontend Architecture (Client)

The React frontend will be responsible for presenting the user interface and interacting with the backend API. Key architectural considerations include:

*   **Component-Based Structure**: Utilizing React's component-based paradigm for modular and reusable UI elements. Components will be organized into `components` (reusable UI), `pages` (page-specific components), and `layouts` (for common page structures).
*   **State Management**: Redux Toolkit will manage the application's global state, ensuring predictable state updates and facilitating data flow across components. Local component state will be managed using React's `useState` and `useReducer` hooks.
*   **Routing**: React Router will handle client-side navigation, providing a seamless user experience.
*   **API Communication**: Axios will be used for all HTTP requests to the NestJS backend, handling data fetching, submission, and error handling.
*   **Styling**: Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS will provide a consistent and responsive design system, enabling rapid UI development and customization.
*   **Form Management**: Libraries like Formik or React Hook Form will be considered for robust form validation and submission, ensuring data integrity.

### 4.2. Backend Architecture (Server)

The NestJS backend will serve as the application's core logic, handling business rules, data processing, and API exposure. Key architectural considerations include:

*   **Modular Structure**: NestJS's modular design will be leveraged to organize features into distinct modules (e.g., `auth`, `users`, `accounting`, `transactions`, `reports`). This promotes maintainability and scalability.
*   **API Layer**: RESTful APIs will be exposed to the frontend, with clear endpoints for each resource and operation. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) will be used for request and response validation.
*   **Service Layer**: Business logic will reside in services, encapsulating complex operations and interacting with the data access layer.
*   **Data Access Layer**: Prisma will be used as the ORM to interact with the PostgreSQL database. This provides a type-safe and efficient way to perform database operations, including migrations and schema management.
*   **Authentication and Authorization**: NestJS's built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT-based authentication, Guards, Interceptors) will secure API endpoints and control access to resources.
*   **PDF Parsing**: A dedicated service or module will handle the parsing of password-protected PDF bank and credit card statements. This might involve integrating with a third-party library for PDF processing and OCR capabilities.
*   **Financial Logic**: Specific modules will be developed for handling complex financial calculations, journal entry generation, ledger management, and financial report generation (Trial Balance, Balance Sheet, P&L).
*   **Error Handling**: A centralized error handling mechanism will ensure consistent error responses and logging.

### 4.3. Database Schema (PostgreSQL with Prisma)

The PostgreSQL database schema will be designed to support the core financial functionalities. Key entities will include:

*   **Users**: User authentication and profile information.
*   **Businesses**: Information about each business managed by a user.
*   **Accounts**: Chart of accounts for each business, including asset, liability, equity, revenue, and expense accounts, with support for GST and TDS.
*   **Journal Entries**: Records of all financial transactions, linked to accounts and entities.
*   **Transactions**: Detailed transaction information, potentially linked to journal entries.
*   **Invoices**: Records of invoices, linked to business accounts.
*   **Persons/Entities**: For tagging journal entries.

Prisma will manage the database schema and migrations, ensuring consistency between the application's data models and the database.

## 5. Data Flow

1.  **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the React frontend to input data (e.g., upload PDF statements, create journal entries) or request reports.
2.  **Frontend API Call**: The React frontend makes an HTTP request to the appropriate NestJS backend API endpoint using Axios.
3.  **Backend Processing**: The NestJS backend receives the request, validates the input (using DTOs), and processes the business logic through its services.
4.  **Database Interaction**: Services interact with the PostgreSQL database via Prisma to retrieve, store, or update financial data.
5.  **Response to Frontend**: The NestJS backend sends a response back to the React frontend, containing the requested data or confirmation of the operation.
6.  **Frontend Update**: The React frontend updates its state (via Redux Toolkit) and renders the changes in the UI.

## 6. Security Considerations

*   **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure user login and session management.
*   **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users only access resources they are authorized for.
*   **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data (e.g., passwords) will be hashed before storage. Data in transit will be secured using HTTPS.
*   **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation on both frontend and backend to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
*   **PDF Security**: Handling of password-protected PDFs will require careful consideration to ensure security and privacy.

## 7. Future Enhancements

*   **Reporting Enhancements**: More advanced reporting features, custom report generation.
*   **Integration with Payment Gateways**: For automated invoice processing and payment reconciliation.
*   **Machine Learning for Categorization**: To automatically categorize transactions and suggest journal entries.
*   **Multi-currency Support**: For businesses operating in multiple currencies.
*   **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all financial transactions and system changes.

## 8. Conclusion

This architectural design provides a solid foundation for the FinT application, leveraging modern technologies and adhering to best practices. The modular approach ensures that the application can be developed incrementally, tested thoroughly, and scaled effectively to meet future demands.
