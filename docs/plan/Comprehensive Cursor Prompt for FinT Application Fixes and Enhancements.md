**Problem:** The Invoice and Bill management features are currently disabled due to issues with Prisma client generation. This is a critical blocker for completing Phase 3 functionalities.

**Action Required:**

*   **Investigate Prisma Schema:** Thoroughly review `server/prisma/schema.prisma` to ensure that the `Invoice` and `Bill` models are correctly defined and do not contain any syntax errors or misconfigurations that might prevent Prisma from generating their respective clients.
*   **Prisma Client Regeneration:** Execute Prisma migration and generation commands to ensure the client is up-to-date and includes the `Invoice` and `Bill` models. This might involve running `npx prisma migrate dev` (if schema changes are intended) followed by `npx prisma generate`.
*   **Dependency Check:** Verify that all Prisma-related dependencies in `server/package.json` are correctly installed and compatible. Reinstalling `node_modules` in the `server` directory might be necessary (`rm -rf node_modules && npm install`).
*   **Error Analysis:** Capture and analyze any error messages during Prisma generation to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure. Provide detailed logs if the issue persists.
*   **Re-enable Services:** Once the Prisma client generation is successful, re-enable the Invoice and Bill services in the backend (e.g., `server/src/pdf-statement/pdf-statement.module.ts`, `server/src/accounting/accounting.module.ts`, and related controllers/services) by uncommenting or re-integrating their respective modules and routes.

### 2.2. Add Account from Transaction Modal

**Problem:** The functionality to add a new account directly from the 


transaction modal is currently not working.

**Action Required:**

*   **Frontend Implementation:** Identify the relevant React component for the transaction modal (likely in `client/src/components/` or `client/src/pages/`). Implement or debug the functionality that allows users to input new account details and submit them. This might involve adding a new form field or a button that triggers a sub-modal for account creation.
*   **API Integration:** Ensure that the frontend correctly calls the backend API endpoint for creating new accounts. Verify the request payload and headers.
*   **Backend Endpoint:** Confirm that the backend has a dedicated and functional API endpoint (e.g., in `server/src/accounting/` or `server/src/chart-of-accounts/`) for creating new accounts. This endpoint should handle validation and persistence to the database.
*   **Error Handling and Feedback:** Implement robust client-side validation and display appropriate error messages or success notifications to the user after an attempt to add a new account.

### 2.3. Sidebar Navigation Links

**Problem:** The sidebar navigation links are not working correctly, preventing users from navigating to different sections of the application.

**Action Required:**

*   **Frontend Routing:** Review the routing configuration in the React application (likely in `client/src/App.jsx` or `client/src/components/layout/Layout.jsx`). Ensure that each sidebar link is correctly mapped to its corresponding route and component.
*   **Link Components:** Verify that the navigation links are using appropriate React Router DOM components (e.g., `<Link>` or `<NavLink>`) and that their `to` props are correctly set.
*   **Event Handlers:** Debug any click event handlers associated with the sidebar links to ensure they are not preventing default navigation or causing unexpected behavior.
*   **Active States:** Confirm that active states for navigation links are correctly applied to provide visual feedback to the user about their current location.

### 2.4. Business/Personal Profile Switch UI

**Problem:** The UI for switching between business and personal profiles is improper, leading to a poor user experience.

**Action Required:**

*   **UI/UX Redesign:** Redesign the business/personal profile switch component (likely in `client/src/components/layout/Layout.jsx` or a related header component) to be more intuitive and visually appealing. Consider using a clear toggle, dropdown, or distinct buttons.
*   **State Management:** Ensure that the frontend correctly manages the state of the active profile (business or personal) and that switching profiles updates the application's context accordingly.
*   **Backend Integration:** If the profile switch involves changing the active business context for data retrieval, ensure that the frontend sends the correct business ID or context to the backend with subsequent API requests.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Provide clear visual feedback to the user about which profile is currently active.
